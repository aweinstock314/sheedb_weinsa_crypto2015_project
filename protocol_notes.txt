username.card:
    should contain:
        PIN
        Signing key
        MAC key

ATM client:
    logout should just sever the connection (maybe? can proxy maliciously keep session open?)
    login should make a socket connection, but not transmit data-containing messages
    there should be a "nonce plz" message

datastructures:

struct username {
    char username[23]; // hard coded max. "alice\0" is 6, so this is plenty. also, prime numbers!
};

struct message {
    uint8_t hmac[64]; // HMAC-SHA256
    struct username username; // server needs to know whose message this is to know whose key to use
    struct payload payload; // HMAC will be taken of this, this will also maybe be encrypted
};

enum msgtype_t {
    NONCEPLZ = 0,
    BALANCE,
    WITHDRAW,
    TRANSFER,
    GOODBYE
}

struct payload {
    msgtype_t msgtype; // the type of the message
    uint8_t nonce[16]; // 128-bit nonce
    uint8_t amount[8]; // used for withdraw/transfer, uint64_t, LE
    struct username destination; // used only for transfer
}
